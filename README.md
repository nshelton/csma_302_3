# Compute Shader Cellular Automata

We're going to implement four types of cellular automata :

 - Conway's Game of Life
 - Rock-Paper-Scissors
 - Reaction Diffusion

## Submitting 
(this is also in the syllabus, but consider this an updated version)

1. Submit your work to a branch on github on this repo (branch should be your firstname-lastname)
When you are finished, "Tag" the commit in git as "Complete". You can still work on it after that if you want, I will just grade the latest commit.

2. The project has to run and all the shaders you are using should compile. If it doesn't I'm not going to try to fix it to grade it, I will just let you know that your project is busted and you have to resubmit.  Every time this happens I'll take off 5%. You have 24 hours from when I return it to get it back in, working. 

3. Late projects will lose 10% every 24 hours they are late, after 72 hours the work gets an F. 

4. Obviously plagarism will not be tolerated, there are a small number of students so I can read all your code. Because it is on git it's obvious if you copied some else's. If you copy code without citing the source in a comment, this will be considered plagarism.
